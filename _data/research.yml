    abstract: ' This study investigates the effects of fossil fuel power plant closures on local migration. I leverage variation in fuel prices and plant age that results in plausibly exogenous power plant retirements. The retirement results in a “stagnation effect” where both in-migration and out-migration decreases, a pattern not consistent with a typical gentrification result of increased in and out migration. My analysis shows that the stagnation effect is more pronounced in lower-income and predominantly Black communities, raising environmental justice concerns. These findings underscore the complex interplay between the environmental advantages and local economic challenges associated with phasing out fossil fuel infrastructure.'

    # related_info: ' Society for the Advancement of Behavioral Economics Conference 2022, SEA-AERE 2022'
    abstract: 'This study investigates the impact of social norms information on consumer behavior regarding eco-labeled products. I focus on three types of norms: injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and working-together normative appeals. Through a choice experiment, I explore how different norms interact with multiple eco-labels. Notably, descriptive norms begin to influence consumer choices when 50% or more of consumers are reported to purchase the product. Consumers exhibit a willingness to pay a premium for eco-labels, and this willingness increases with the number of labels presented. Under treatments involving injunctive norms and working-together appeals, both descriptive norms information and certified eco-labels contribute to higher willingness-to-pay values. These findings provide insights for promoting green consumption and environmental improvement through strategic norms communication.'
